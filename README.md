# University Schedule Generator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A web app coded using React and Typescript which attemps to find the best possible schedule given a list of classes, by ranking every combination of classes possible and allowing the user to customize the weights.

Currently, there is no hosted website for this; however, since this is a static web app, finding a free hosting service should be relativally easy. (As a matter of fact, github can host these, so this might be deployed to github pages)

# How to run

Since this project is based on create-react-app:

Make sure you have `npm` installed, and then:

-   `npm start`: Runs app in development mode at localhost:3000.
-   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

(See https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started for more information)
