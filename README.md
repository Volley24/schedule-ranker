# University Schedule Generator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A web app coded using React and Typescript which attemps to find the best possible schedule given a list of classes, by ranking every combination of classes possible and allowing the user to customize the weights.

Currently, there is no hosted website for this; however, since this is a static web app, finding a free hosting service should be relativally easy. (As a matter of fact, github can host these, so this might be deployed to github pages)

# How to access

The latest version can be found at https://volley24.github.io/schedule-ranker/.

**Please note that the schedule ranker is currently in pre-release mode, and bugs/inconsistencies may arrise at any time.**
